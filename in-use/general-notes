Revising

You will learn most effectively if you revise the units you study:
* a week after you first worked on the unit.
* again after a month.

Dictionaries
You will be able to gain much more from the language presented in this
book if you follow up words that especially interest you in a good
learner's dictionary (Unit III). By doing this you can extend your
vocabulary still further.

You may find, for example
* other useful collocations.
* other meanings for the words you look up.
* other words based on the same root.

Personalizing words

Write any new words or phrases that you particularly wish to learn
wish to learn in a context which has personal meaning for you.

Grouping words
It is very useful to organize a set of vocabulary items being studied
into groups. It does not matter how you group those words or whether
your groupings would make sense to anyone else or not. It is thinking
about the words enough to create groups that improves how we learn
these words.
*As another revision technique, try organizing the words you have
worked on in a unit into three or four (or more) groups in any way
that you find appropriate.
