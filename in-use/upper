What does knowing a new word mean?

* It is not enough just to know the meaning of a word. You also need
  to know:
  a) what words it is usually associated with
  b) whether it has any particular grammatical characteristics
  c) how it is pronounced
* Try to learn new words not in isolation but in phrases.
* Write down adjectives together with nouns they are often associated
  with and vice versa, e.g. royal family; rich vocabulary
* Write down verbs with the structure and nouns associated with them,
  e.g. to add to our knowledge of the subject; to express an opinion.
* Write down nouns in phrases e.g. in contact with; a train set;
  shad4s of opinion.
* Write down words with their prepositions, e.g. at a high level;
  thanks to your help.
* Note any grammatical characteristics of the words you are
  studying. For example, note when the word is irregular and when a
  noun is uncountable or is only used in the plural.
* Make a note of any special pronunciation problems with the words
  you're learning

10 to 20 words or expressions a week is OK for me I suppose.

Maybe I will learn them before dinner and/or on my way to school,
well, at least on a regular basis.

I will revise my work  weekly
