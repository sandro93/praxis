Time

One thing before another

Before I went to work I fed the cat. ( more common in written English
is - Before going to work..)

I had written to her prior to meeting the community ( /prior to is
formal/written style/)

The city was called Something formerly. ( /formerly is used when
things change their name, state, etc./

I was in the office after 2:30 PM, earlier on I was somewhere else. (
earlier on is fairly informal)

It was nice to be in Venice. Previously I had been only to
Rome. (previously is formal, more informal would be before that)

Things that happen at the same time

While I waited, I read the newspaper. ( while waiting I read the newspaper)
As I was driving to work, I saw an accident. ( as describes the
background while something happens in the foreground).
I saw her just as she was turning the corner ( precise moment.)
She was entering the very moment/ at the very time I was leaving. (are
more precise than as or just as.)
During the war I was living in Dublin (not specifies how long.)
Throughout the war the food was rationed. (from  beginning to end.)

One thing after another

After I'd locked up, I went to bed (more formally or in written
English would be - after locking up ... .)

First we went to the castle. Afterwards we caught a bus to the beach.
