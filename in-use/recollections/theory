After reading through the chapter /with close attentions/ I will
reproduce the main points as a written summary.

Perhaps I will create templates for that purpose.

[This document is specific to English Vocabulary in Use and related
texts, though I will make something similar suitable for other
studies.]

Before going too far in planning how I will organize this activity, I
will read one chapter as a sample and write what I remember.

#Maybe the following note will be kill/yanked somewhere else later

I will not make notes before doing recollection, ?
and also later I will make a full idea of how I will carry learning
diary. 


And again, I have not decided yet how I will organize learning diary
and vocabulary notebook.
